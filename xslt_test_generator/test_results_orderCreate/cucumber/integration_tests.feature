Feature: Integration Tests for OrderCreate_MapForce_Full
  As a QA engineer
  I want to test integration scenarios
  So that I can ensure XSLT transformation quality

  Background:
    Given the XSLT transformation file "../resource/orderCreate/xslt/OrderCreate_MapForce_Full.xslt"
    And the transformation engine is initialized

  @medium_priority @integration
  Scenario: Verify that parameters passed to vmf:vmf1_inputtoresult are correctly processed and reflected in the output.
    When the XSLT transformation is executed
    And Verify template integration
    And Check data flow

  @medium_priority @integration
  Scenario: Verify that parameters passed to vmf:vmf2_inputtoresult are correctly processed and reflected in the output.
    When the XSLT transformation is executed
    And Verify template integration
    And Check data flow

  @medium_priority @integration
  Scenario: Ensure that the / template calls vmf:vmf1_inputtoresult, vmf:vmf2_inputtoresult, vmf:vmf3_inputtoresult, and vmf:vmf4_inputtoresult in the correct order.
    When the XSLT transformation is executed
    And Verify template integration
    And Check data flow

  @medium_priority @integration
  Scenario: Verify that vmf:vmf3_inputtoresult correctly utilizes the output from the / template.
    When the XSLT transformation is executed
    And Verify template integration
    And Check data flow

  @medium_priority @integration
  Scenario: Ensure that data generated by the / template is correctly passed to vmf:vmf4_inputtoresult.
    When the XSLT transformation is executed
    And Verify template integration
    And Check data flow

  @medium_priority @integration
  Scenario: Verify that the combined output from all templates called by / is as expected.
    When the XSLT transformation is executed
    And Verify template integration
    And Check data flow
