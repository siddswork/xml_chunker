Feature: Path Coverage Tests for OrderCreate_MapForce_Full
  As a QA engineer
  I want to test path coverage scenarios
  So that I can ensure XSLT transformation quality

  Background:
    Given the XSLT transformation file "../resource/orderCreate/xslt/OrderCreate_MapForce_Full.xslt"
    And the transformation engine is initialized

  @medium_priority @path_coverage
  Scenario: Test the main entry point with valid data
    When the XSLT transformation is executed
    And Verify path execution
    And Check coverage completeness

  @medium_priority @path_coverage
  Scenario: Test the main entry point with invalid user ID
    When the XSLT transformation is executed
    And Verify path execution
    And Check coverage completeness

  @medium_priority @path_coverage
  Scenario: Test the main entry point with missing action parameter
    When the XSLT transformation is executed
    And Verify path execution
    And Check coverage completeness

  @medium_priority @path_coverage
  Scenario: Test the main entry point with an unsupported action
    When the XSLT transformation is executed
    And Verify path execution
    And Check coverage completeness

  @medium_priority @path_coverage
  Scenario: Test the main entry point with valid data and a different action
    When the XSLT transformation is executed
    And Verify path execution
    And Check coverage completeness

  @medium_priority @path_coverage
  Scenario: Test the main entry point with valid data and a delete action
    When the XSLT transformation is executed
    And Verify path execution
    And Check coverage completeness

  @medium_priority @path_coverage
  Scenario: Test the main entry point with valid data and a logout action
    When the XSLT transformation is executed
    And Verify path execution
    And Check coverage completeness

  @medium_priority @path_coverage
  Scenario: Test the main entry point with valid data and a search action
    When the XSLT transformation is executed
    And Verify path execution
    And Check coverage completeness
