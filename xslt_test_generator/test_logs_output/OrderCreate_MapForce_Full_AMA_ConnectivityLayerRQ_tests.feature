Based on the provided analyses of the XSLT transformation and XSD schema, here are comprehensive Gherkin test scenarios that cover various aspects of the transformation logic, including happy path scenarios, business rule testing, data validation, edge cases, error scenarios, and integration testing.

```gherkin
Feature: XSLT Transformation of AMA_ConnectivityLayerRQ

  Background:
    Given a valid XML input structure for AMA_ConnectivityLayerRQ

  # Happy Path Scenarios
  Scenario: Successful transformation with valid input
    Given the input XML contains a valid correlationID
    And the input XML contains a valid TravelAgency with Name and Contact
    And the input XML contains a valid actor with ID and PTC
    When the transformation is applied
    Then the output should contain a CorrelationID
    And the output should contain TravelAgencySender with Name
    And the output should contain Passenger with PassengerID and PTC

  # Business Rule Testing
  Scenario: Transformation of document type identifiers
    Given the input XML contains document type 'P'
    When the transformation is applied
    Then the output should map to 'VPT'

  Scenario: Transformation of offer identifiers
    Given the input XML contains offer type 'V'
    When the transformation is applied
    Then the output should map to 'VVI'
  
  Scenario: Transformation of email and mobile
    Given the input XML contains a valid email
    When the transformation is applied
    Then the output should map the email to 'Voperational'
    
    Given the input XML contains a valid mobile number
    When the transformation is applied
    Then the output should map the mobile number to 'Voperational'

  # Data Validation
  Scenario: Missing optional fields
    Given the input XML is missing the Email element
    When the transformation is applied
    Then the output should still contain all required elements

  Scenario: Validating required elements
    Given the input XML is missing the correlationID
    When the transformation is applied
    Then the output should indicate an error or return an empty string for CorrelationID

  # Edge Cases
  Scenario: Special character handling in phone numbers
    Given the input XML contains a mobile number with special characters "123-456-7890"
    When the transformation is applied
    Then the output should contain a sanitized mobile number "1234567890"

  Scenario: Boundary values for optional fields
    Given the input XML contains the maximum allowed characters for a name
    When the transformation is applied
    Then the output should correctly reflect the name without truncation

  # Error Scenarios
  Scenario: Invalid input values for vmf templates
    Given the input XML contains an invalid document type 'X'
    When the transformation is applied
    Then the output should return an empty string for the document type mapping

  Scenario: Missing required data
    Given the input XML is missing the actor element
    When the transformation is applied
    Then the output should indicate an error or return an empty string for Passenger

  # Integration Testing
  Scenario: Multiple actors in input
    Given the input XML contains multiple actor elements
    When the transformation is applied
    Then the output should contain multiple Passenger elements with corresponding IDs and PTCs

  Scenario: Full integration with valid input
    Given the input XML contains a valid structure with correlationID, TravelAgency, and multiple actors
    When the transformation is applied
    Then the output should correctly reflect the hierarchy of elements in AMA_ConnectivityLayerRQ
    And all required fields should be populated correctly
```

### Scenario Outlines for Parameterized Testing
```gherkin
Scenario Outline: Transformation of document type identifiers
    Given the input XML contains document type "<inputType>"
    When the transformation is applied
    Then the output should map to "<expectedOutput>"

    Examples:
      | inputType | expectedOutput |
      | P         | VPT            |
      | PT        | VPT            |
      | V         | VVI            |
      | R         | VAEA           |
      | K         | VCR            |

Scenario Outline: Handling special characters in mobile numbers
    Given the input XML contains a mobile number "<mobileNumber>"
    When the transformation is applied
    Then the output should contain a sanitized mobile number "<expectedSanitized>"

    Examples:
      | mobileNumber      | expectedSanitized |
      | 123-456-7890     | 1234567890       |
      | (123) 456-7890   | 1234567890       |
      | +1 123 456 7890  | 11234567890      |
```

These Gherkin scenarios cover a wide range of test cases for the XSLT transformation logic, ensuring that both the happy paths and edge cases are thoroughly tested. Each scenario is designed to validate the transformation logic, business rules, data validation, and error handling, providing a comprehensive testing framework for the transformation process.
